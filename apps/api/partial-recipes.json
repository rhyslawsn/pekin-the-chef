    "description": "Papa John's original hand-tossed pizza dough that aims to mimic the slightly sweet and chewy texture of the famous recipe.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 1/3 cups warm water (around 110°F)",
      "1 tablespoon sugar",
      "2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast (one packet of active dry yeast)",
      "4 cups all-purpose flour (can substitute bread flour for a chewier texture)",
      "2 tablespoons olive oil (plus extra for greasing)",
      "1 1/2 teaspoons salt"
    ],
    "directions": [
      "In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for about 10 minutes until it becomes frothy.",
      "In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until the mixture begins to come together into a dough.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 7-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough hook.",
      "Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning once to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.",
      "Punch down the risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide it into 2 equal parts for making two pizzas. Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten to form a pizza base to your desired thickness.",
      "Place the shaped dough on pizza pans or a lightly floured counter-top. Cover lightly with a cloth and let them rise again for about 20-30 minutes.",
      "Preheat your oven to the highest temperature (450-500°F or 230-260°C) with a pizza stone inside if you have one. If you're using a pizza pan, no preheating is necessary for the pan.",
      "Top your pizza as desired and bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.",
      "Remove the pizza from the oven, slice, and serve hot."
